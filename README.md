# Tries-Contacts

We're going to make our own Contacts application! The application must perform two types of operations: 
1. add name, where name is a string denoting a contact name. This must store name as a new contact in the application.
2. find partial, where partial is a string denoting a partial name to search the application for. It must count the number of contacts starting with partial and print the count on a new line.

Given n sequential add and find operations, perform each operation in order.

**Input Format**

- The first line contains a single integer, n, denoting the number of operations to perform. 
- Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains an operation in one of the two forms defined above.

**Constraints**

- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 1 <= |name| <= 21
- 1 <= |partial| <= 21
- It is guaranteed that name and partial contain lowercase English letters only.
- The input doesn't have any duplicate name for the add operation.

**Output Format**

- For each find partial operation, print the number of contact names starting with partial on a new line.

**Sample Input**

> 4
> add hack
> add hackerrank
> find hac

**Sample Output**
